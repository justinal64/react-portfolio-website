# Portfolio Website

For the last 6 months I have been on a journey to learn React. I have create a mobile application using React-Native, but this is the first full app I have created using React. I recreated my portfolio website using React and Semantic UI for styling. I hope you like what you see.


## Getting Started

To download the project open up a terminal and type
```
git clone git@github.com:justinal64/react-portfolio-website.git
```
This will download the project to your local computer. 

Next cd into the project
```
cd react-portfolio-website
```
Once you are in the proper directory type
```
npm install
```
to install all the project dependencies.
<br />
Next run 
```
npm start
```
in the terminal to run the application locally
