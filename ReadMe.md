# TheSocialApp Frontend React Native App

For the last 6 months I have been on a journey to learn React. I have create a mobile application using React-Native, but this is the first full app I have created using React. I recreated my portfolio website using React and Semantic UI for styling. 


## Getting Started

To download the project open up a terminal and type
```
git clone git@github.com:justinal64/react-portfolio-website.git
```
This will download the project to your local computer. 

Next cd into the project
```
cd react-portfolio-website
```
Once you are in the proper directory type
```
npm install
```
to install all the project dependencies.

<!-- Click "Sign Up" and create a new user. Once you have done that you will automatically be logged into the app.

<br />
The next tab is where you would add friends. 
<br />
![Users](./app/images/screenshots/users.png)
<br />
The next is where you would keep and delete notes.

and finally the profile page is where you can edit your personal information and delete posts you have created.
